# Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG 
1. Ground clearance and length of vehicle are likely to provide a variance to the model. Therefore the vehicles ground clearance and length have significant impact of mpg. Other variance can include the spoiler type and angle, AWD and vehicle weight.
2. P-Value: Much smaller than the significance level of 0.05%. This indicates there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis.
3. Our model has an r-squared value of 0.71 - 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model. The multiple regression model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
4. Removing vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD - Predictability does decrease, but not drastically (r-squared value falls from 0.7149 to 0.674).
