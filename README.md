# Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG 
1. Ground clearance and length of vehicle are likely to provide a variance to the model. Therefore the vehicles ground clearance and length have significant impact of mpg. Other variance can include the spoiler type and angle, AWD and vehicle weight.
2. P-Value: Much smaller than the significance level of 0.05%. This indicates there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis.
3. Our model has an r-squared value of 0.71 - 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model. The multiple regression model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
4. Removing vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD - Predictability does decrease, but not drastically (r-squared value falls from 0.7149 to 0.674).


# Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

- MechaCar suspension coils policy - Suspension coils cannot exceed 100 pounds per square inch (PSI). 
- When looking at the production lot, the variance of the coils is 62.29 PSI (must be below 100 PSI).
- Lot 1 (0.98 PSI) and Lot 2 (7.47 PSI) - Within the 100 PSI requirement 
- Lot 3 is showing variance in consistency & performance at 170.29 PSI.
